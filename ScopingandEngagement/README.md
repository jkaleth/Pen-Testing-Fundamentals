# Scoping & Engagament
 
 ## Scoping
 
 This involves defining the boundaries and objectives of the penetration test. It includes determining the goals, identifying the systems and assets to be tested, understanding the rules of engagement, and outlining the limitations of the test. 
 
 Scoping ensures that both the tester and the client understand the objectives and constraints of the assessment.

 ### Scoping includes:

 - Scope Definition
 - Target list
 - Restriction Identification

 ## Engagement

  This refers to the active phase of the penetration test where the agreed-upon testing methodologies are put into action. It involves conducting various activities such as reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation to simulate real-world attacks. During the engagement, testers adhere to the defined rules of engagement, maintain communication with stakeholders, and gather as much data as possible to identify vulnerabilities and assess the security posture of the systems being tested.

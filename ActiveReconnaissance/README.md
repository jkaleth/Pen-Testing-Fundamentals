# PenTest+ - Active Reconnaissance

## WEhat is it?

Active reconnaissance in cybersecurity refers to the proactive and direct approach used by threat actors or security professionals to gather information about a target network or system. Unlike passive reconnaissance, which involves collecting publicly available data without directly interacting with the target, active reconnaissance involves actively probing and interacting with the target's infrastructure to gather more detailed information.

Here are some common techniques used in active reconnaissance:

**Port Scanning** This involves scanning the target system's ports to identify which ports are open and what services are running on those ports. It helps attackers or security professionals understand the potential vulnerabilities and services available on the target system.

- NMAP
- ZENMAP

**Network Scanning:** This technique involves scanning the network to identify active hosts, IP addresses, and their associated services. It helps in creating a map of the network topology, which can be exploited or secured depending on the intent.

**Vulnerability Scanning:** It involves using automated tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the target system or network. These tools search for known security weaknesses, outdated software, misconfigurations, or other issues that could be exploited.

**Enumeration:** Enumeration involves actively querying the target system for specific information, such as user accounts, network shares, or system configurations. This helps attackers understand the structure and potential entry points of the system.

Active reconnaissance is a crucial phase in both offensive and defensive cybersecurity strategies. Ethical hackers or penetration testers might perform active reconnaissance as part of security assessments to identify and remediate vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them. However, when performed by malicious actors, active reconnaissance can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromises.
